# Project1
Goal: To combine restaurant finding and recipe finding into one webapp <br>
This project has the following abilities:
- Makes calls to server APIs: Yelp Fusion API and EDAMAM's Recipe Search API
- Checks for user inputs and set as API parameters
- Shows results based on user inputs

<br>

This project consists of the following files:
- index.html: Restaurant finder page and the landing page when it is first loaded
- recipeFinder.html: Recipe finder page
- script.js: Manage API calls to Yelp Fusion API and show results for index.html/Restaurant finder page
- script2.js: Manage API calls to EDAMAM's Recipe Search API and show results for recipeFinder.html
- style.css: General styling of index.html and recipeFinder.html

<br>

This project is made using **HTML5**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, **jQuery**, **Bootstrap**, **Yelp Fusion API** and **EDAMAM's Recipe Search API** <br>
This project is currently hosted on Github Pages: https://elwinung0120.github.io/Project1/<br>
